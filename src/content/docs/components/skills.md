Skills are the atomic building blocks of competencies. At WGU, skills are represented as [Rich Skill Descriptors (RSDs)](https://ottonomy.gitlab.io/rsd-respec/). The [Skills Architecture](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/sites/skillsarchitecture) team publishes the [WGU Skill Library](https://www.wgu.edu/lp/general/wgu/skills-library.html), which [Educational Product Designers](/roles/educational-product-designer) use to write [competencies](/components/competencies).
