Competencies are the fundamental building block of learning at WGU. They are a "measurable, assessable capability of an individual to successfully complete activities and perform tasks at a determined level, ranging from a fundamental awareness to advanced application of knowledge and skills"[^1].

When writing competencies, designers define its title, statement, level, and identify contributing skills (RSDs).

Competencies have three required primary parts: an introduction, the lesson(s), and an outro.

## 1. Intro

The introduction is our chance to engage the learner and establish the overarching theme or topic of the competency.

### Welcome the learner enthusiastically

A warm welcome is essential for fostering a positive learning environment, as it builds rapport, makes learners feel valued, and enhances their engagement. It also helps reduce anxiety and apprehension, setting a positive tone for the learning experience.

<CollapseCard title="Examples">
	- Hi! Welcome to *Becoming an Advocate for Inclusivity and Cultural
	Awareness*.
  - Welcome to *Becoming an Advocate for Inclusivity and Cultural
	Awareness*, a journey where we embrace diversity and foster understanding
	together!
  - Hello and a heartfelt welcome to *Becoming an Advocate for
	Inclusivity and Cultural Awareness*!
</CollapseCard>

### Gain the learner's active attention

Capturing the learners' attention at the start sets the stage for effective learning by ensuring they are mentally prepared and focused on the material. A learner’s motivation is often tied to how much they think the material is important or useful.

<Card title='Examples'>
	#### Begin with an interesting story or anecdote, possibly from a workplace
	setting, to illustrate how the competency benefits them professionally. Show a
	surprising or intriguing video on the topic to immediately engage learners and
	highlight the subject's importance. Pose a challenging question or problem
	that relates to real-world applications, encouraging learners to see the
	material's practical value.
</Card>

### Plan the learning with the learner

Explain the resources we provide for building competence and invite the learner to assess their current level of competence. Explain the learning pattern and why it was chosen.

<Card title='Examples'>
	Provide a roadmap or agenda for the learning experience. Provide learners with
	self-assessment tools or quizzes to help them gauge their existing knowledge
	and skills. Encourage reflection on areas of strength and those requiring
	improvement, aiding in the customization of their learning plan. Set clear
	expectations for assessments and participation.
</Card>

## Lessons

## 3. Outro

Conclude the learning experience by reinforcing key points, assessing the learner’s knowledge and skill, and encouraging them to continue learning and practicing.

### Review and Reiterate Importance

Summarize the main concepts covered in the learning experience, emphasizing their relevance and application. This helps solidify the learner's understanding and appreciation of the material.

### Assess for Understanding

Use assessments to evaluate the learners' grasp of the material, providing both you and the learner with valuable feedback on their progress and areas for improvement.

<Card title="Examples">

Implement a quiz or a short test focusing on the core concepts of the course.
Encourage learners to participate in a reflective exercise, such as a journal entry or discussion, to self-assess their understanding.
Offer a practical assignment or case study that requires applying the concepts learned, serving as a real-world test of their knowledge.

</Card>

### Enhance Retention and Transfer

Provide strategies and tools to help learners retain and apply the knowledge and skills they have acquired.

<Card title="Examples">

Suggest ongoing practices or habits that can help integrate the competencies into daily life.
Offer additional resources, such as reading materials, websites, or communities, for continued learning.
Encourage learners to teach a concept they've learned to someone else, as teaching is a powerful tool for reinforcing knowledge.

</Card>

### Explore What's Next

Guide learners towards the next steps in their learning journey, whether it's advanced courses, related topics, or practical applications.

<Card title="Examples">

- Introduce upcoming courses or modules that build on the current material.
- Suggest related areas of study or skills that complement what they have learned.
- Encourage participation in community groups, forums, or events where they can continue to grow and apply their skills.

</Card>

### Congratulate and Sign Off

End on a positive note by acknowledging the learner's effort and achievements, and provide a warm, encouraging sign-off.

<Card title="Examples">

Congratulate the learners on completing the course and commend their dedication to personal and professional growth.

Express confidence in their ability to apply what they've learned in real-world scenarios.

Sign off with a personal touch, such as "Keep advocating for inclusivity and cultural awareness in all that you do!"
