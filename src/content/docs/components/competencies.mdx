Competencies are the fundamental building block of learning at WGU. They are a "measurable, assessable capability of an individual to successfully complete activities and perform tasks at a determined level, ranging from a fundamental awareness to advanced application of knowledge and skills"[^1].

When writing competencies, designers define its title, statement, level, and identify contributing skills (RSDs).
