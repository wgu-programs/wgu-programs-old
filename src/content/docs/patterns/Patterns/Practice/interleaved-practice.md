Interleaved practice is an evidence-based learning technique that involves mixing distinct yet related skills, topics, or problem types within a single study session instead of focusing on one skill at a time. This method promotes better retention and transfer of knowledge, as it challenges the brain to recognize and apply appropriate strategies to solve diverse problems.
