## 2. Gain the learner’s active attention

Capturing the learners' attention at the start sets the stage for effective learning by ensuring they are mentally prepared and focused on the material. A learner’s motivation is often tied to how much they think the material is important or useful.

#### Possible Approaches:

- Begin with an interesting story or anecdote, possibly from a workplace setting, to illustrate how the competency benefits them professionally.
- Show a surprising or intriguing video on the topic to immediately engage learners and highlight the subject's importance.
- Pose a challenging question or problem that relates to real-world applications, encouraging learners to see the material's practical value.
- Incorporate topics or examples that align with students' interests, like using sports statistics in math lessons for sports enthusiasts, to make the material more relatable and engaging.

### 3. Involve the learner in learning plan

Explain the resources we provide for building competence and invite the learner to assess their current level of competence. Explain the learning pattern and why it was chosen.

#### Possible Approaches:

- Provide a roadmap or agenda for the learning experience.
- Provide learners with self-assessment tools or quizzes to help them gauge their existing knowledge and skills.
- Encourage reflection on areas of strength and those requiring improvement, aiding in the customization of their learning plan.
- Set clear expectations for assessments and participation.
