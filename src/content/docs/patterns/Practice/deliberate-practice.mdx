## 1. Intro

The introduction is our chance to engage the learner and establish the overarching theme or topic of the competency.

### Welcome the learner enthusiastically

A warm welcome is essential for fostering a positive learning environment, as it builds rapport, makes learners feel valued, and enhances their engagement. It also helps reduce anxiety and apprehension, setting a positive tone for the learning experience.

<CollapseCard title="Examples">
 - Hi! Welcome to *Becoming an Advocate for Inclusivity and Cultural
 Awareness*.
  - Welcome to *Becoming an Advocate for Inclusivity and Cultural
 Awareness*, a journey where we embrace diversity and foster understanding
 together!
  - Hello and a heartfelt welcome to *Becoming an Advocate for
 Inclusivity and Cultural Awareness*!

### Gain the learner's active attention

Capturing the learners' attention at the start sets the stage for effective learning by ensuring they are mentally prepared and focused on the material. A learnerâ€™s motivation is often tied to how much they think the material is important or useful.

<CollapseCard title='Examples'>
 Begin with an interesting story or anecdote, possibly from a workplace
 setting, to illustrate how the competency benefits them professionally. Show a
 surprising or intriguing video on the topic to immediately engage learners and
 highlight the subject's importance. Pose a challenging question or problem
 that relates to real-world applications, encouraging learners to see the
 material's practical value.

### Plan the learning with the learner

Explain the resources we provide for building competence and invite the learner to assess their current level of competence. Explain the learning pattern and why it was chosen.

<CollapseCard title='Examples'>
 Provide a roadmap or agenda for the learning experience. Provide learners with
 self-assessment tools or quizzes to help them gauge their existing knowledge
 and skills. Encourage reflection on areas of strength and those requiring
 improvement, aiding in the customization of their learning plan. Set clear
 expectations for assessments and participation.
