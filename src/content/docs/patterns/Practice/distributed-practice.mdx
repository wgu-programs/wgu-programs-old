title: Distributed Practice
excerpt: Distributed Practice reviews material over increasing time intervals to solidify learning in long-term memory. Using flashcards is an example of Retrieval Practice.

:::tip[When to use]

    - Enhance long-term retention by spreading out practice sessions over time. 
    - A study plan that incorporates time intervals between practice sessions.
    - At the end of a section, suggest steps (tasks and timeframes) for students to take for study techniques.
    - Formative assessment intentionally includes items from previous lessons (example in lesson 3, weave in concepts from lessons 1 and 2). Can tag information for students to see that this is testing recall. Two separate blocks – 1 for new information from lesson and 1 for information from previous lessons.
    - If students do not get recall questions correct, add link back to placement in course content AND can provide link for additional content for learning (video, article, etc.).
    - Implied timeframe by integration into course within suggested timeframe and placement in course.

:::
Distributed practice is a learning technique that involves spreading study sessions over time instead of cramming them into a short period. By allowing time between practice sessions, learners can consolidate and strengthen their memories, resulting in more effective long-term retention of knowledge and skills.

## Chunk content
    - Split information into smaller sections or topics, such as facts, vocabulary, or concepts.  

## Begin with the first section
    - Understand it well using study aids like flashcards or summaries.  

## Review at longer intervals
    - Gradually increase the time between reviews, e.g., one day, three days, a week. (Possibly not specific time periods, but by suggested time periods or by intentionally by placement in course)

## Apply active recall
    - Answer questions or solve problems without looking up information to strengthen memory.

## Evaluate progress
    - Regularly test yourself to determine if adjustments are needed in intervals or focus. (Can be done through formative assessments as recall in later lessons.)

## Introduce new material
    - Add new sections to the spaced repetition schedule to balance old and new information.
