A design problem engages learners in creating unique solutions, products, systems, or processes, considering various factors and constraints while emphasizing critical thinking, creativity, decision-making, and collaboration.

- Design is not a linear process.
- Provide learners with the agency for decision-making and design.
- Usually leads to a performance assessment.
