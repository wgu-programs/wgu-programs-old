    - 'When learners need to develop strategic thinking and adaptability in problem-solving.  '
when_to_use_2_when_to_use:
    - 'You could give students a flowchart and they use it to solve a problem (ex. checklists in operating rooms). '
when_to_use_3_when_to_use:
    - 'Branching when the rules or goal change. Learners need to understand the steps or process but prepared to pivot and then get back to the rules. '
