title: 'Distributed Practice'
excerpt: 'Distributed Practice reviews material over increasing time intervals to solidify learning in long-term memory. Using flashcards is an example of Retrieval Practice.'

    - 'A study plan that incorporates time intervals between practice sessions.  '
requirements_1_requirement:
    - 'At the end of a section, suggest steps (tasks and timeframes) for students to take for study techniques.'
requirements_2_requirement:
    - 'Formative assessment intentionally includes items from previous lessons (example in lesson 3, weave in concepts from lessons 1 and 2). Can tag information for students to see that this is testing recall. Two separate blocks – 1 for new information from lesson and 1 for information from previous lessons.'

    - 'If students do not get recall questions correct, add link back to placement in course content AND can provide link for additional content for learning (video, article, etc.).'

Distributed practice is a learning technique that involves spreading study sessions over time instead of cramming them into a short period. By allowing time between practice sessions, learners can consolidate and strengthen their memories, resulting in more effective long-term retention of knowledge and skills.
