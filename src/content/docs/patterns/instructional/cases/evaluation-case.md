An evaluation case requires learners to evaluate the “worth, value, performance, effectiveness, outcome, or consequences (for example, of a decision that has been made) of the subject” (Ellet, 2018, p. 47). The purpose of the evaluation is “to give people information that can help them improve something or that assists them in making a choice or recommendation” (Ellet, 2018, p. 47).
