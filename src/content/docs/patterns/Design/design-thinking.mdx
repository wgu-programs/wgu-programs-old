Design thinking is a human-centric, iterative problem-solving method that involves empathy, experimentation, and iteration to create innovative solutions. This pattern focuses on understanding the users and their needs, generating ideas, prototyping, testing, and refining solutions.

:::tip[When to use]

- Design an innovative, human-centered solution to a complex problem.
- When solving complex and ill-defined problems
- When creating user-centered solutions or innovations
- When dealing with situations where multiple perspectives are involved
:::

:::tip[Requirements]

- A problem or challenge to be addressed
- A target user group or audience
- A collaborative and open-minded team
