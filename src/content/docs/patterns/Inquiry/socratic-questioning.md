Socratic questioning is a dialectical and inquiry-based approach to learning aimed at stimulating critical thinking and uncovering deeper insights through a series of thought-provoking questions. This pattern involves engaging in a dialogue, where the questioner challenges the respondentâ€™s assumptions, beliefs, and reasoning to facilitate self-reflection and intellectual growth.
